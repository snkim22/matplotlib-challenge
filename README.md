# Pymaceuticals Inc.
----------------------


#### You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

#### As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

#### The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

#### Instructions
- Prepare the data.
- Generate summary statistics.
- Create bar charts and pie charts.
- Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
- Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
- Calculate correlation and regression.
- Submit your final analysis.

### Analysis

- Capomulin and Ramicane have the lowest average, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error tumor volumes. These two regimines may be the most effective drugs in reducing tumor volume. However, there are some possible outliers in the data.
- There is an approximately equal distribution of male and female mice in the dataset. Gender may not play a signifiant role in any observed differences between treatment groups.
- There is a relatively strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen (0.84). As the weight of the mice in the study increases, the average tumor volume tends to increase as well.
